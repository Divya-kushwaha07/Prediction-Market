# Prediction Market

## Project Description

The Prediction Market smart contract is a decentralized platform that allows users to create and participate in prediction markets on future events. Users can create markets with binary outcomes (Yes/No), purchase shares representing their predictions, and earn rewards based on the accuracy of their predictions. The contract implements a simple but effective mechanism for price discovery through market participation.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a transparent, decentralized prediction market platform that harnesses the collective wisdom of crowds to forecast future events. By removing intermediaries and utilizing blockchain technology, we aim to provide a trustless environment where users can engage in predictive trading with complete transparency and automated settlement.

The platform seeks to democratize access to prediction markets, enabling anyone to create markets about events they care about while providing economic incentives for accurate predictions. This creates a self-regulating ecosystem where the most informed participants are rewarded for their insights.
